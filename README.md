### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My [blog](https://blog.bmannconsulting.com) is where you'll see bits and pieces of activity, most of which is cross posted to Mastodon [@bmann@social.coop](https://social.coop/@bmann). You can peer into the depths of my brain by looking through my [second brain / notes garden](https://bmannconsulting.com).

I'm the co-founder of @fission-codes [Fission](https://github.com/fission-codes).

For front end devs, check out the [Webnative SDK](https://webnative.dev): a local-first, edge computing stack.

We also do a significant amount of protocol engineering work around open standards at Fission. Check out the [@fission-codes README for a full list and links Â»](https://github.com/fission-codes/#building-protocols-for-the-future-of-the-internet)

I'm interested in open source, cooperative and collective models, and supporting developers and other makers in getting paid.
