### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Boris Mann, and I am based in Vancouver, BC, Canada.

I post a lot of [short journal entries](https://bmannconsulting.com/journa/) which are cross-posted to most social networks you can name. [bmann.ca](https://bmann.ca) has a full list of places where you might find me. 

Github stars are publicly posted to [ðŸ¦‹ Bluesky @bmannconsulting.com](https://bsky.app/profile/bmannconsulting.com)

I'm interested in open source, cooperative and collective models, [proto apps](https://bmannconsulting.com/notes/proto-apps/) and [open social protocols](https://bmannconsulting.com/notes/open-social-protocols/) and supporting developers and other makers in getting paid.
