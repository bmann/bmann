### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm the co-founder of @fission-codes [Fission](https://github.com/fission-codes). We're a protocol research team working on distributed systems, cryptography, and edge compute.

Our main product is the [Everywhere Computer](https://everywhere.computer), running serverless Wasm functions from browser to server.

Other open source protocols and research are linked from the [@fission-codes README Â»](https://github.com/fission-codes/#building-protocols-for-the-future-of-the-internet)

I post a lot of [short journal entries](https://bmannconsulting.com/journa/) which are cross-posted to most social networks you can name. [bmann.ca](https://bmann.ca) has a full list of places where you might find me. 

I'm interested in open source, cooperative and collective models, and supporting developers and other makers in getting paid.
