### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My [microblog](https://microblog.bmannconsulting.com) is where you'll see bits and pieces of activity, most of which is cross posted to Twitter [@bmann](https://twitter.com/bmann). You can peer into the depths of my brain by looking through my [notes garden](https://bmannconsulting.com).

I'm the co-founder of [Fission](https://github.com/fission-suite). The Fission SDK is called [webnative](https://github.com/fission-suite/webnative). It lets you build apps that include authentication, file storage, data, and more, as well as let 10 or 10,000 users use the app, all using front end, client side tools.

I'm interested in open source, licensing, cooperative and collective models, and supporting developers and other makers in getting paid.
